            <h4>Ben & Anissa Coleman</h4>
            <h4 class="home-stars">★★★★★</h4>
            <p>"The Dynamic Duo of David and Jared Brewer is one of the best if not The Best in the business of Real
                Estate. They are beyond exceptional. They are humble and true professionals through and through.
                They helped me purchase my first home, and then after closing a military career, helped me sell my
                first home to enable me to move closer to family. They're truly like family, very personable, very honest
                and straight forward. They have a combined 30+ years experience in real estate that is on full display
                when purchasing or selling a home. I have no issues recommending David and Jared to anyone who
                desires to own or sell a home within the entire Commonwealth of Virginia. If I could take them with me
                to help buy. a home in Texas, I very much would. Hate leaving them behind, but Love the fact that they
                will continue to be a great service to the people of Virginia who are coming there for the first time, or
                have been there for a lifetime."</p>
