                <h3>David Brewer</h3>
                <p>I’ve been a full-time Realtor for over 22 years and have had the privilege of serving Dave Ramsey clients for more than 11. My passion is helping people make smart, stress-free real estate decisions while always putting their best interests first. I believe in honest guidance, clear communication, and delivering results that truly matter. The greatest satisfaction is when our clients thank me and my team for a job well done. I’m grateful for the opportunity to serve so many wonderful clients and to be part of a values-driven community that prioritizes trust, integrity, and service.</p>

            <h3>Jared Brewer</h3>
            <p>As a dedicated real estate professional, I’m passionate about helping clients navigate one of life’s biggest decisions with clarity and confidence. Growing up around the business, I developed a deep appreciation for the importance of communication, trust, and doing things the right way. I take pride in being responsive, detail-oriented, and fully committed to providing a smooth and positive experience — whether buying your first home or selling your current one.

                Working alongside my father, David, I’ve had the privilege of learning from his 22+ years of experience while bringing a fresh, tech-savvy approach to our team. I value the relationships we build with our clients and the opportunity to guide them through each step of the process with honesty and care.</p>
